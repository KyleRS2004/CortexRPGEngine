# CortexRPGEngine
A free and open source game engine I am developing as a learning project for C.  Currently I am pretty new to programming, including in the C language, which I have a lot of interest into.  This project is licensed under the GPLv3 license.  If you wish to license the project under different terms you will need to contact me.

It should be noted that this project will for now mainly focus on my additions to it, but you are free to fork the project and I may accept merge requests.
Ideally, if you plan to merge any additions to this project, you should heavily document the code so that I understand the gist of how it works.  Because again, this for me is a learning project.

The type of game engine currently is just going to be a text based adventure game tool kit type thing.  It could eventually become a 3d RPG game engine, but for now it will remain a text based RPG game engine.


**Currently the coding environment is extremely simple for the most part**
-Codeblocks IDE
-Ubuntu is the OS I am running everything on.
-GCC compiler is the one I am using.(With default settings setup by CodeBlocks IDE)
