# CortexRPGEngine
A free and open source game engine I am developing as a learning project for C.  Currently I am pretty new to programming, including in the C language, which I have a lot of interest into.  This project will be licensed under the GPLv3 license for public usage.  If you wish to license the project under different terms you will need to contact me.
